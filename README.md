can use functions for firebase backend - but we dont use this in this project using realtime database

Using Firebase as a Backend

In the next lecture, we'll use a third-party service called [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as a dummy backend.

**You can get started with Firebase for free** - all you need is a Google account.

Then, once logged in with Google, you can create a **new project** with the default settings. Though you can disable "Google Analytics".

Thereafter, click **"Build"** and select **"Realtime Database"** and click **"Create Database"**.

The region doesn't matter but make sure to create the database in **"Test mode"**!

This will create the database with a connected REST API that we'll use throughout this section.

You can then **use the URL displayed on the screen** in your React code to send requests to that database. That's what we'll do throughout the next lectures.
